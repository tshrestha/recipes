# Apple Pie

This recipe involves creating an all-butter crust from scratch and par boiling the apples
which yields a very nice texture.

## The Crust

|:-------------------|:-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|**2 ½ cups**        | Bob's Red Mill Pastry flour. All purpose flour can be substituted.           |
|**2 ½ sticks**      | Unsalted butter. Sliced into ¼ inch cubes and then _chilled_ in the freezer. |
|**2 table spoons**  | Sugar.                                                                       |
|**1 tea spoon**     | Fine kosher/sea salt.                                                        |
|**7 table spoons**  | _Ice cold_ water.                                                            |

### Steps

In a large bowl, add **1 cup of flour**, **sugar** and **salt**. Mix or whisk together until
everything is evenly distributed.

Add the **chilled butter** to the flour mix. Using a dough blender, cut the butter into the
flour until you get shaggy clumps of the flour and butter mixture. There should be no dry
bits of flour.

Add the remaining flour and mix while adding **1 table spoon of ice cold water** at a time.
Mix until you can form a rough ball of dough. Do not over mix.

Divide the dough into two equal pieces. Then, flatten each piece into a 6 inch disc.
Individiually wrap each disc in platic wrap and refrigerate for at least 2 hours.
Ideally, you can refrigerate overnight or up to twelve hours.

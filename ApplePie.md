|**2 ½ cups**        | Bob's Red Mill Pastry flour. All purpose flour can be substituted.           |
|**2 ½ sticks**      | Unsalted butter. Sliced into ¼ inch cubes and then _chilled_ in the freezer. |
|**2 table spoons**  | Sugar.                                                                       |
|**1 tea spoon**     | Fine kosher/sea salt.                                                        |
|**7 table spoons**  | _Ice cold_ water.                                                            |

### Steps

In a large bowl, add **1 cup of flour**, **sugar** and **salt**. Mix or whisk together until
everything is evenly distributed.

Add the **chilled butter** to the flour mix. Using a dough blender, cut the butter into the
flour until you get shaggy clumps of the flour and butter mixture. There should be no dry
bits of flour.

Add the remaining flour and mix while adding **1 table spoon of ice cold water** at a time.
Mix until you can form a rough ball of dough. Do not over mix.

Divide the dough into two equal pieces. Then, flatten each piece into a 6 inch disc.
Individiually wrap each disc in platic wrap and refrigerate for at least 2 hours.
Ideally, you can refrigerate overnight or up to twelve hours.

## The Filling

| Amount             | Ingredient                                     |
|:-------------------|:-----------------------------------------------|
| **3 of each**      | Honey Crisp, Braeburn, and Grannysmith apples. |
| **½ cup**          | Sugar.                                         |
| **1 tea spoon**    | Ground cinnamon                                |
| **¼ tea spoon**    | Ground nutmeg                                  |
| **¼ tea spoon**    | Fine kosher/sea salt                           |
| **2 table spoons** | Corn starch                                    |

### Steps

Fill a large pot with water, up to the halfway mark, and set it to boil. While boiling,
peel then slice the apples into ¼ inch thin slices.

Once the water is at a rolling boil, carefully add the apples to the pot, and turn off
the heat. Stir the pot to ensure the apples are properly distributed, then let it
sit for 10 minutes.

Drain the apples into a colander, then let it cool and dry for about an hour. Once the
apples are sufficiently cool, transfer them to a large bowl.

Add the **sugar**, **cinnamon**, **nutmeg**, **salt**, and **corn starch** to the apples.
Mix until the apple slices are properly coated. Let the mixture rest for at least an hour
to let the juices extract from the apple slices.

Pour the extracted juice into a saucepan and add a ¼ stick of unsalted butter. Reduce over
medium heat, stirring continuously until thickened. Once it is thick and syrupy, remove it
from the heat and pour it over the apples and mix.

## The Bottom Crust

Using a rolling pin, roll the pie crust disc until it's about 11 inches in diameter. Then
roll it over a 9-inch pie dish and seat it properly. Put it back in the fridge.

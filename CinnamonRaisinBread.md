## Steps

### Autolyse

This steps helps get a head start on creating the gluten structure in the dough.

1. Mix the **whole wheat flour** and the **bread flour** in a large bowl.
2. Add **750 grams** of luke warm water (the other 50 grams is
   saved for mixing in the salt later).
3. Mix until you have a shaggy dough and there is no dry flour left.
4. Cover the bowl and let the dough rest for at least 30 - 60 minutes. Longer is better.

### Starter

1. Pour and spread the **starter** over the dough.
2. Mix until the starter is properly incorporated. It's helpful to pinch the dough together and fold
   it over it self.
3. Let the dough rest for 20 - 30 minutes.

### Salt, Cinnamon and Raisins

1. Sprinkle the **salt**, **raisins** and **cinnamon** over the dough.
2. Pour **50 grams** of **luke warm water** over the dough.
3. Mix by folding the dough over it self. Give the bowl a quarter of after each fold. Mix for 5 - 10
   minutes.
4. Let the dough rest for 15 minutes.

### Bulk Rise

Depending on the temperature this period can range from 4 - 6 hours. Ideally, you want the bulk rise
to happen at 78 - 80 degrees F. The cooler the room temperature, the longer the bulk rise will take.
The following steps are for a 4 hour bulk rise period. Adapt according to your room temperature.

During the first hour, stretch and fold the dough every 15 minutes. For the second hour do it every
thirty minutes. Then, once every hour until the bulk rise is complete.

#### Stretch and fold technique

1. Wet your hand that you will touch the dough with so that it doesn't stick to you.
2. Slide your hand under the dough, then grab and stretch it up. Once it feels like it won't stretch
   anymore fold it down.
3. Give the bowl a quarter turn and repeat 3 more times.
4. Repeat this step every 15 minutes for the first hour, every 30 minutes the second hour, and once
   every hour until the bulk rise is complete.
   
### Pre Shaping & Shaping

1. Prepare a working surface. Dump the dough on the surface so that that part that was on the bottom of
   the bowl is now on top.
2. Split the dough evenly into two pieces. Each piece should weigh about 1110 grams.
2. Since it is way to difficult for me to explain dough shaping, I'm going to share a video link instead:
    * [Watch this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEG1BjWroT0) to learn how to shape dough.
3. Place the shaped dough in a banneton or a bread pan.
    * If using a banneton, properly flour the inside surface to prevent the dough from sticking to it.
      Place the dough with the smooth surface facing down (seam side up).
    * If using a bread pan, coat the inside surface with butter (vegan butter is ok). Then dust some
      flour over it. Place the dough in the pan with smooth side up (seam side down)
4. Cover the dough giving the top enough room for rise. Let it rest in room temperature for 1 hour.
5. Move the dough to the fridge and let it rest for 8 - 12 hours.

### Baking

#### Bread Pan

Adding moisture in the oven helps the bread rise. You can add a pan with boiling pan in the oven
under the bread.

1. Put the bread pan in a cool oven.
2. Turn on the oven to 375 degrees F.
3. Bake for 1 hour and 10 minutes.

#### Dutch Oven

1. Place dutch oven in the oven
1. Preheat oven to 450 degrees F. Dutch oven has to be hot!
1. Lay down a piece of parchment paper.
2. Flip the banneton over the parchment paper and lift carefully.
3. Optionally, score the dough vertically.
4. Holding the edges of the parchment paper, carefully lift the dough and place it in the dutch oven.
5. Bake with the lid on for 30 minutes. Then, take the lid off and bake for an additional 15 minutes.
